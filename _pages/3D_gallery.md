## Introduction

Over the last couple of years, I have tried myself at learning the basics in Blender, to give a more lively representation to the products and designs I have come up with. This is a small collection of what I have done until now. Obviously none of this is at a professional level, but I think I can say, that it is enough to make some product shots.
