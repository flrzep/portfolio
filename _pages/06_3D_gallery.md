## Introduction

Over the last couple of years, I have tried myself at learning the basics in Blender, to give a more lively representation to the products and designs I have come up with. I also like to make small stylized animations to improve my modelling skills. All of the images in here are fully modelled by me. Obviously none of this is at a professional level, but I think I can say, that it is enough to make some product shots and visualizations.
